# Chronological Notes

## Purpose:
Exploring what I have learned so far in [Coursera's Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjo9ZyPyv75AhVeGzQIHaScBUIQFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fgoogle-data-analytics&usg=AOvVaw2XvP900KPIKu1611eqZ7QH). This log should serve as a compilation of all the actions, research, and progess on my final project with Coursera. The topic is Bookish. Please visit -ReadMe link, to be inserted later- for more details.

## 5-Sept-22 
When uploading the Goodreads-books by Soumik dataset to *BigQuery*, I had to find and replace all instances of " to a single quote '. 
*BigQuery* was receiving an error and failed to upload with the double quote.

## 6-Sept-5
Uploaded Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009-2019 by Sooter Saalu into *BigQuery*. Currently, finding relative datasets from Kaggle to explore using SQL. My intent is to compare multiple Bookish datasets. I am considering exploring other datasets that are outside of Goodreads, but at this time, I continue using Goodreads datasets as the main source of information. 

Potential courses of action:
- Word cloud visualization for titles, genres, or reviews.
- Datasets outside of Goodreads. It appears that the Amazon Top 50 compiles the information from Goodreads based on Saalu's notebook in Kaggle.


## Datasets Used:
- [Goodreads-books by Soumik](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks).
- [Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019).
