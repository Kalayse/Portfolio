# Portfolio

## About Me:
Previously, I have worked in the data entry and the management scope of the data life cycle. Now, I find myself enamored with data story telling with data analytics through viewing and manipulating raw data. I may be newer to the world of github, data analytics, and coding langauges, but I have the tenacity and drive to always keep learning. My goal is to use GitHub in order to keep myself organized with projects and notebooks. Lots of learning code is trial, error, and collaboration. My intention in the future weeks is to take what I have learned and continue to foster it. I find myself asking the questions, and trying to find the answers. I spend lots of time looking and deciphering other peoples' work in addition to trying to implement their methods in a way that is uniquely me.

## Long Term Goal:
For the long term health of my career, I am pivoting into the data analytics community. This portfolio seeks to compile the skills and knowledge I have learned while  taking certifications for data analytics including R Programming, SQL, and data visualizations through various modalities. 

## Current Short Term Goal:
To take the [Oracle MySQL 8.0 Database Administrator](https://education.oracle.com/mysql-80-database-administrator-also-available-in-chs-for-taiwan/pexam_1Z0-908) exam by the end of April 2022.

## Successes:
Over the last year, I have completed Google's Data Analytics Certification on Coursera, utilitized Version Control through Git and RStudio, manipulated raw data and worked with packages in R (including ggplot and many aspects of tidyverse), generated and maintained various Google Sheets for personal logging (such as videogame economy and maximizing my ingame currency), and continued to make my way through Learning SQL by Alan Beaulieu.

## Fun Fact:
Not that this will be surprising for *my type of people*, but I seem to always have at least 2 half consumed drinks within arm's reach.
