# Portfolio
A place for me to focus on questions that I seek answers too. My goal is to use the knowlegde I have gained and build onto it to make a portfolio worth sharing with those that are interested.

# About Me:
I'm new to the world of github, data analytics, and coding langauges. My goal is to use GitHub in order to keep myself organized with projects and notebooks. Lots of learning code is trial, error, and collaboration. My intention in the future weeks is to take what I have learned and continue to foster it. I find myself asking the questions, and trying to find the answers. I spend lots of time looking and deciphering other peoples' work in addition to trying to implement their methods into my own word.

# Currently Working On:
I'm in the final stages of my inital attempt at a portfolio. Over time, I will need to continue to update my portfolio as I learn new skills and better ways to of doing things. 

# Fun Fact:
Not that this will be surprising for *my type of people*, but I seem to always have at least 2 half consumed drinks within arm's reach.
