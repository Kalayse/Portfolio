# Portfolio
## Goal:
My goal is to pivot into a career change on step at a time. The goal of this portfolio is to compile the skills and knowledge I have learned while endeavoring to teach myself more about data analytics including R, SQL, and data visualizations. 

# About Me:
Previously, I have worked in the data entry and management end of the data life cycle. Now, I am working to more towards data story telling with data analytics. I'm new to the world of github, data analytics, and coding langauges. My goal is to use GitHub in order to keep myself organized with projects and notebooks. Lots of learning code is trial, error, and collaboration. My intention in the future weeks is to take what I have learned and continue to foster it. I find myself asking the questions, and trying to find the answers. I spend lots of time looking and deciphering other peoples' work in addition to trying to implement their methods into my own word.

# Currently Working On:
I'm in the final stages of my inital attempt at a portfolio. Over time, I will need to continue to update my portfolio as I learn new skills and better ways to of doing things. 

# Fun Fact:
Not that this will be surprising for *my type of people*, but I seem to always have at least 2 half consumed drinks within arm's reach.
