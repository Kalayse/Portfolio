# Case Study - Bookish

## Introduction:
This section is meant to be used as my self guided exploration for my Bookish Case Study. The intent with this document is to outline the data analysis process
so that I might better stay on task, asking the right questions, and exploring each section fully. Additionally, this section will contain some of the
guiding principals from Google's Data Analytics Professional Certification on Coursera. The information contained within this case study is purely based on my
interest and curiousity in the topic.

## Ask Phase:
- What topic are you exploring? `The topic that I'm exploring is related to my interests as a user of Goodreads and as a bookish person. I want to take
datasets and explore book ratings, book genres, book titles, and sales and see how they relate to each other.`
- What is the problem you're trying to solve? `I would like to see the trend in books overall as they compare to ratings and sales. I want to review titles and keywords as they compare to sales, overall ratings for books that appear to have good sales, and see if there's an impact of a book that may seem trendy even though it isn't rated well.`
- What metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objectives? Who are your stakeholders?

## Process Phase:

- How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?

## Analyze Phase:
- How should you organize your data to perform an analysis on it?
- Has your data been properly formatted?
- What surprises did you discover in your data?
- What trends or relationships did you find in the data?

## Share Phase:
- What story does your data tell?
- How do your findings relate to your original question?
- Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?

## Act Phase:
This phase is added to complete the data analysis process. There will be no action for the Act Phase on my behalf.
