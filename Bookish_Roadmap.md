# Case Study - Bookish

## Introduction:
This section is meant to be used as my self guided exploration for my Bookish Case Study. The intent with this document is to outline the data analysis process
so that I might better stay on task, asking the right questions, and exploring each section fully. Additionally, this section will contain some of the
guiding principals from Google's Data Analytics Professional Certification on Coursera. The information contained within this case study is purely based on my
interest and curiousity in the topic.
